Comparison for memory usage during compilation of a fresh next.js project with pages router between nodejs runtime and edge runtime. The only change done after creating the project was to multiply the default page with different names and in different subdirectories.

`main` branch has the nodejs runtime. `runtime-experimental-edge` has the edge runtime.
